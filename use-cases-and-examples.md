## Use Case #1: Manufacturing Production Data Integration

### **The Challenge:**
Manufacturing company had production data in 5 different systems:
- ERP system with order data
- MES system with actual production metrics
- Quality control database
- Shipping system
- Excel spreadsheets from floor supervisors

IT estimated 6 months and $75K to build integration. Operations needed it now.

### **The Solution (Built by Operations Manager):**
Operations Manager with Power BI background learned to use VS Code + Copilot to:
- Pull data from each system via APIs (AI wrote the code)
- Combine and clean data based on business rules (they described the logic, AI implemented it)
- Create automated daily reports sent to stakeholders
- Build alert system for production issues

**Time to working solution:** 3 weeks  
**Cost:** Workshop training ($8K) + their time  
**Ongoing maintenance:** They handle it themselves

## Use Case #2: Project Portfolio Dashboard Beyond Power BI

### **The Challenge:**
Construction company needed project profitability dashboard that:
- Pulled from accounting system, project management tool, and timesheets

- Generated client-ready reports automatically

Power BI couldn't handle the API integrations and automation required.

### **The Solution (Built by Finance Director):**
Finance Director who knew the profitability calculations but wasn't a programmer:
- Described business logic to AI, which wrote the code
- Built data pipeline pulling from all systems
- Created automated reporting that runs nightly

Your business domain experts have the knowledge. AI has the coding capability. You just need the bridge between them.

That's what we provide.
