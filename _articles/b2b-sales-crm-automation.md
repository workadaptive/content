## The Shift Happening Now

**Agentic AI's transforming B2B sales—fast.**

**Old way:** Sales ops builds reports and dashboards  
**New way:** Sales ops deploys AI agents that work continuously

Competitors' AI agents are enriching leads 24/7. Their pipeline monitoring catches risks before yours do. Their reps spend 12+ more hours/week actually selling.

**The gap widens every week you wait.**

## What Your Sales Ops Team Can Build

**Impact:** 200+ hours/month saved, +35% conversion rate, reps start calls fully prepared

### Example 2: Pipeline Health Monitor

**Built by:** Revenue ops analyst, CRM/analytics background, 3 weeks

**What it does:** Analyzes engagement patterns across email, calls, meetings. Detects at-risk deals 2-3 weeks before they're obvious. Calculates forecast confidence based on actual data. Alerts managers to deals needing attention. Generates weekly pipeline health reports automatically.

**Impact:** Forecast accuracy 65%→89%, saved $800K in at-risk deals, 20% faster cycles

### Example 3: Territory Optimization Engine

**Built by:** Sales strategy lead, analytics background, 4 weeks

**What it does:** Scores accounts for expansion opportunity, identifies white space in existing customers, optimizes territory assignments based on data, monitors account health and alerts to changes, recommends rep focus and priorities daily.
