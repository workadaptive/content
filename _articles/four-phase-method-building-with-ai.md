There's a massive gap between AI coding tutorials and reality.

I mean a really big gap.

**Tutorials say:** "Just describe what you want to AI and it builds it!"

**Reality:** That works for "write me a Python script to sort CSV files."

It fails spectacularly for "Build a system that pulls customer data from Salesforce, enriches it from 10+ sources, applies our specific business scoring rules, handles our edge cases, and integrates back to our CRM with proper error handling and monitoring."

The difference? 

Complex business problems require systematic context building.

One-shot prompts hit a complexity ceiling fast. Real solutions need a methodical workflow.

This is mine.

I've used this to build dozens of production systems. Sales automation. Financial close processes. Manufacturing data integration. Pipeline intelligence tools.

Not as a developer, mind you. As a business expert who understands the problem deeply and uses AI to handle the technical implementation.

Here's how it actually works.
