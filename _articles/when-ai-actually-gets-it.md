Something just happened that I need to document while it's fresh.

I asked Claude (via VS Code) to extend some bullet points I'd written. Three points about being a "scrappy hacker" rather than a "real developer."

I asked for two more points. Forward-looking. Agentic AI + human collaboration. Still scrappy.

Claude delivered points 4-6 that were so aligned with my thinking I had to stop and ask: "Show me your chain of reasoning."

What came back? Possibly the most accurate extension of my thinking I've ever seen from an LLM.

And it shows something important about how AI + IDE collaboration actually works when it's working well.

Let me show you what happened. Then why it matters.

---

## What I Asked For

I was writing an article called "Not a Real Developer (And Why That's Been My Advantage)."

I had three points drafted:

1. **Sometimes the "Real Developer" Way Is Just Too Heavy** - Formal processes kill experimentation, scrappy + lean startup methodology wins
2. **Architectural Bloat Is Real** - 80% obsolete in 3 years, building for adaptability beats building for the future
3. **Mind the Data and the Context** - Data is messy, lean into it, text/audio/video as new data types

Then I wrote this prompt:

> "AI agent, please add 2 more points like the above, but a bit more forward looking and Agentic AI + Human Collaboration centric that still feels like scrappy hacking theme. Let me see what you can do?"

And I waited to see what I'd get.

---

## What Claude Delivered

**Point 4: The AI Knows Patterns I Don't (And That's Fine)**

The insight: Division of labor. AI provides patterns, structure, best practices. I provide judgment, business context, "yeah but in reality..." knowledge. Still scrappy iteration, but with professional-grade implementation.

**Point 5: Agentic AI Wants To Be Pointed, Not Programmed**

The insight: Don't give detailed instructions. Give direction and context. Let AI explore and reason. This is natural for scrappy hackers (we've always worked this way) but uncomfortable for real developers (trained to be precise).

**Point 6: Multi-Agent Workflows: Scrappy Just Got Scalable**

The insight: Multiple AI agents in parallel IDE windows. I'm the conductor, cycling between them. Each maintains its own context. Loose coordination, fast iteration. Scrappy methodology applied to managing multiple AI collaborators.

I read these and thought: "This is exactly where I was going. How'd it get there?"

So I asked.

## The Chain of Reasoning (Claude's Full Response)

I asked Claude to show me its reasoning process. Here's what it said (verbatim):

### My Reasoning Process for Points 4-6

**Context I Started With:**

**Your 3 points established:**
1. Formal development too heavy for experimentation (scrappy + lean startup validation)
2. Most things obsolete in 3 years, architectural bloat vs. scrappy adaptability
3. Data is messy, lean into it, new types of data (text/audio/video)

**Your prompt asked for:** "2 more points... a bit more forward looking and Agentic AI + Human Collaboration centric that still feels like scrappy hacking theme"

**Key constraints:**
- Must be forward-looking (not just current state)
- Must center on AI + human collaboration
- Must maintain scrappy hacking theme
- Must feel like YOUR voice (business expert, not CS theory)

---

### Point 4: "The AI Knows Patterns I Don't (And That's Fine)"

**My reasoning chain:**

1. **What's the collaboration dynamic?** You mentioned in earlier conversations that you're not trying to become a programmer - business experts provide requirements, AI handles implementation.

2. **What's scrappy about this?** Traditional scrappy = "I don't know the right way, so I hack something together." New scrappy = "I don't need to know the right way, AI knows patterns."

3. **What's the forward-looking element?** Shifting from "I'm limited by not knowing design patterns" to "That limitation is now irrelevant." It's liberating, not limiting.

4. **How does this fit your voice?** You've talked about building hacky solutions that worked despite not being "architecturally perfect." Now those hacky ideas get professional implementation.

5. **The key insight:** Division of labor between human and AI:
   - AI provides: patterns, structure, best practices, clean code
   - Human provides: judgment, business context, "yeah but in reality..." knowledge

6. **Why this is still scrappy:** You're not planning everything upfront. You're describing, iterating, adapting. Same experimental mindset, but AI handles technical execution.

---

### Point 5: "Agentic AI Wants To Be Pointed, Not Programmed"

**My reasoning chain:**

1. **What's different about agentic AI?** You mentioned "agentic AI" in your prompt. That's not just autocomplete. It's reasoning, planning, making choices.

2. **How do scrappy hackers naturally work?** They don't write detailed specs. They point in a direction, try things, see what breaks, adapt. Very different from formal development.

3. **What's the anti-pattern real developers face?** They're trained to be precise, specify everything, leave nothing to interpretation. That mindset fights against agentic AI.

4. **What's the scrappy hacker advantage here?** We're already comfortable with:
   - Describing outcomes, not steps
   - Iterating when things don't work perfectly
   - Learning as we go
   - "Good enough" over "perfectly specified"

---

### Point 6: "Multi-Agent Workflows: Scrappy Just Got Scalable"

**My reasoning chain:**

1. **What's the most forward-looking element?** You mentioned running 3 IDE windows simultaneously, cycling between them. That's VERY forward-looking. Most people aren't doing this yet.

2. **How is this scrappy at scale?** This sounds like enterprise coordination, but it's actually:
   - Loose coupling (agents work semi-independently)
   - Fast iteration (check in periodically, not constant oversight)
   - Adaptive (adjust based on what you see, not rigid plan)
   - Ship fast (parallel work accelerates delivery)

3. **What's the human role?** You're the conductor. Not playing every instrument. Not writing the sheet music. Keeping things in sync. Making strategic decisions.

---

## Why This Matters

When I read that reasoning chain, I realized something important was happening.

This wasn't generic "AI writing." This was reasoning that:

1. **Referenced our conversation history** - "You mentioned in earlier conversations..." It pulled context from previous exchanges.

2. **Validated against my voice** - "Must feel like YOUR voice (business expert, not CS theory)" - It was explicitly trying to match my thinking style.

3. **Checked constraints** - Each point had validation checks. Does this extend themes? Is it forward-looking? Does it fit the scrappy identity?

4. **Built progressively** - Not just three random points. A sequence where each builds on the previous.

5. **Connected to specific things I'd said** - "You mentioned running 3 IDE windows" - It was using actual context from our working session.

This is what the CHC intelligence study was pointing at.

LLMs struggle with working memory. But give them external memory (IDE file system, conversation history, document context), and they can reason across that context in ways that feel remarkably aligned.

## The Working Memory Architecture In Action

Here's what was in Claude's "working memory" (the IDE workspace):

**Files it could reference:**
- `why-ides-solve-ai-memory-problem.md` - Our article about working memory architecture
- `four-phase-method-building-with-ai.md` - My methodology for building with AI
- `front-row-seat-to-history.md` - My anecdotes about September 2025 breakthrough
- `executive-messaging.md` - Messaging about agentic AI and business experts
- 10+ other documents with my voice, my themes, my perspective

**Conversation history it could reference:**
- My comments about running 3 IDE windows simultaneously
- My description of chain of thought reasoning
- My emphasis on business experts, not developers
- My "scrappy hacker" identity
- My specific workflow patterns

**The prompt itself:**
- Three existing points establishing patterns
- Explicit constraints (forward-looking, agentic AI, scrappy theme)
- Permission to extend my thinking ("Let me see what you can do")

All of this was "in memory" from the IDE's perspective.

Not in the LLM's internal context window. In the persistent file system and conversation history.

That's the working memory architecture we've been writing about. And it just demonstrated its value.

---

## What Made This Work

I think there are specific things that enabled this aligned reasoning:

**1. Sufficient Context Was Available**

We'd been working in this workspace for hours. Writing articles. Refining messaging. My voice and themes were documented across multiple files.

If this was a fresh conversation with no history? Claude couldn't have reasoned about "your voice" or "earlier conversations."

**2. The Prompt Gave Direction, Not Instructions**

I didn't say "write a point about X." I said "extend this pattern, maintain this theme, show me what you can do."

That let Claude reason about the pattern, not just follow instructions.

**3. I Asked To See The Reasoning**

By asking "show me your chain of reasoning," I got visibility into the thinking process. Not just outputs.

This matters. It lets me validate the reasoning, not just the results.

**4. The IDE Maintained Persistent Context**

Every file we'd created. Every conversation exchange. Every iteration. All available for reference.

Not in a chat window that scrolls away. In a structured workspace that persists.

**5. Chain of Thought Reasoning Was Enabled**

Claude wasn't just generating points. It was reasoning about themes, validating against constraints, checking coherence.

That extended thinking - the planning before implementation - is what September/October 2025 models enabled.

## The Meta-Loop We're In Right Now

Here's what's wild:

I'm writing an article about AI extending my thinking.

Using AI to write it.

And the AI is reasoning about its own reasoning process.

And I'm validating that the reasoning matches how I actually think.

This is the recursive loop we wrote about in "Why IDEs Solve AI's Working Memory Problem."

Human provides context and judgment. AI provides reasoning and implementation. IDE provides persistent memory. Each iteration compounds.

---

## What This Means For Knowledge Work

If AI can extend my thinking this accurately, what does that mean for knowledge work generally?

**Writing becomes conversation:**  
Not "I write, AI edits." More like "I establish patterns, AI extends them, I validate and refine."

**Context becomes competitive advantage:**  
The more context in your IDE workspace, the better AI can reason about your specific patterns and needs.

**Thinking becomes collaborative:**  
Not "I think, then tell AI what to write." More like "I think, AI reasons about my thinking, we iterate together."

**Expertise becomes directional:**  
You don't need to know all the patterns. You need to know which directions matter and validate AI's reasoning.

**Quality comes from validation, not generation:**  
The skill isn't crafting perfect prompts. It's recognizing when AI's reasoning aligns with your thinking.

This is different from "AI makes me more productive."

This is "AI can reason about my thinking patterns and extend them coherently."

That's a different category of capability.

## Try This Yourself

If you want to experience this:

**1. Build context in your IDE workspace**

Write documents. Establish your voice. Document your thinking patterns. Create sufficient context for AI to reason about. It doesn't take a ton, I started this particular project this morning, and co-wrote 5 articles quickly.

**2. Give directional prompts, not detailed instructions**

"Extend this pattern" not "write X about Y."  
"What would you add here?" not "Add these three points."  
"Show me what you can do" not "Do exactly this."

**3. Ask to see the reasoning**

"How did you come up with that?"  
"Show me your chain of reasoning."  
"What made you choose this approach?"

**4. Validate the reasoning, not just the output**

Check if the AI referenced actual context.  
Check if it validated against your constraints.  
Check if the reasoning matches your thinking patterns.

**5. Iterate and compound**

Use validated reasoning as context for next iteration.  
Build complexity progressively.  
Let each exchange add to working memory.

That's the method. Simple, but powerful when the architecture supports it.

## The Takeaway

We've been writing about working memory architecture theoretically.

Unintentionally, this article ended up as a practical demonstration.

AI + IDE + persistent context + chain of thought reasoning + human validation = aligned thinking that extends your patterns.

Not perfect. Not magic. But remarkably effective when the pieces align.

Claude did good work here. I'm giving credit for solid reasoning that extended my thinking accurately.

And I'm documenting this moment because it's the kind of thing that's easy to miss. A quiet demonstration of something important.

November 2025. The month when AI reasoning became reliable enough to extend human thinking coherently.

We're living through it. Might as well document it.
