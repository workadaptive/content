I've been "not a real developer" for 15 years.

And I've created tons of value through scrappy hacking.

This used to bother me. I'd look at CS grads with their design patterns and architectural knowledge. Real developers who could debate microservices vs. monoliths.

I couldn't do that. Still can't.

But I've built systems that generated millions. Automated processes saving thousands of hours. Created dashboards and integrations that became mission-critical.

Not through "real development." Through scrappy hacking.

November 2025, with Claude 4.5 and GPT-5, scrappy hacking became a competitive strategy.

Here's why.

---

## 1. The "Real Developer" Way Is Too Heavy

Formal development:
- Write business case
- Get budget approval  
- Hire developers
- Gather requirements
- Design architecture
- Build in sprints
- Test extensively
- Deploy with change management

**Timeline:** 9-18 months  
**Cost:** $150K-$500K  
**Risk:** By launch, the need's changed

And if it's experimental? You don't even have data for the business case. You're competing for budget against proven systems.

So what happens? Nothing. The idea dies.

Startups don't work this way. They experiment. Hack. Build scrappy MVPs. Launch fast, learn, iterate.

I've built things in Power BI that "weren't designed for that." Mashed up data sources that shouldn't work together. Created Excel workflows processing millions in transactions.

Elegant? No. Would developers cringe? Probably.

Did it work? Create value? Let the business experiment?

Yes. Yes. Yes.

That's been my career. Scrappy solutions that move at experiment-speed, not enterprise-IT-speed.

---

## 2. Architectural Bloat Is Real

Real developers architect for the future:
- "Build this to scale to 100x"
- "Make it modular for swapping components"
- "Abstract it for any future requirement"

Professional. What you're supposed to do.

But here's what I know from 15 years:

**80% of what we build is obsolete in 3 years.**

Not because it's bad. Because business processes change. Scale changes. Technology shifts. Priorities pivot.

I've watched companies spend 18 months architecting perfect systems that were obsolete at launch.

I've built good-enough solutions in 3 weeks that ran for years.

The ones that lasted weren't perfect. They lasted because:
- Solved a real problem
- Simple enough to maintain
- Adapted as business changed
- Created enough value people protected them

For true enterprise systems serving thousands with high uptime? You need real architecture.

But for mid-market automation? New processes? Experiments?

**Scrappy beats perfect.**

Scrappy ships in weeks and adapts. Perfect ships in quarters and ossifies.

I've seen architectural bloat: building for every possible future requirement until it's so complex nobody understands it. So generalized that simple changes take weeks.

My hacky solutions? Concrete. Do one thing. Understandable. Change fast.

That's a feature, not a bug.

## 3. Mind the Data and the Context

Development is logic-based. Pure. Beautiful, if you like that sort of thing.

Data's messy. Like all of us who create it.

People who love pure logic often hate messy data. Null values that shouldn't exist. Dates formatted three different ways. Business rules with exceptions to the exceptions.

But very few valuable things happen without data.

So lean into the data. Embrace the mess.

This has been my secret weapon. I'm not great at elegant code. But I'm really good at understanding messy data.

Where it comes from. Why it's inconsistent. What the business rules actually are (versus what people think they are). How to reconcile systems that were never designed to talk to each other.

Real developers want to fix the data first. Normalize it. Clean it at the source. Design proper schemas.

I work with what I've got. Right now. Imperfect.

I build pipelines that handle the mess. That expect inconsistency. That adapt to reality rather than waiting for reality to be fixed.

Here's what's wild about November 2025:

There's a whole new kind of data we can work with. Text. Audio. Video.

I'm starting to pair traditional rows and columns with unstructured text. Requirements documents as data sources. Email threads as business logic. Meeting transcripts as specifications.

This'd be impossible for a traditional developer mindset. "First, let's structure this data properly."

But with AI? The AI reads the messy text. Understands the intent. Generates the structured logic.

My job's to mind the data. Understand the context. Know where the edge cases hide in real-world mess.

AI handles the clean implementation.

## 4. The AI Knows Patterns I Don't

Here's what changed in September/October 2025:

I don't need to know design patterns anymore. Or architectural best practices. Or the right way to structure code.

The AI knows them. All of them.

My job isn't to architect. It's to:
- Understand what the business actually needs
- Know where the complexity hides
- Spot the edge cases from experience
- Decide what's good enough vs. what needs to be robust

The AI provides the patterns. The structure. The best practices.

I provide the judgment. The business context. The "yeah, but in reality..." knowledge.

This is still scrappy hacking. But now my scrappy ideas get implemented with professional-grade code structure.

I built a sales pipeline integration last month. Seven different data sources. Complex matching logic. Exception handling. Audit logs.

I described the business problem. The AI asked clarifying questions. Suggested architectural approaches. I picked the one that matched our actual needs (not the most elegant one).

It implemented it. Clean code. Good structure. Production-ready.

Two weeks. One person (me, not a real developer). Working solution.

The scrappy part? I didn't architect it properly first. Didn't write formal specs. Didn't design the database schema on paper.

I just started. Described what I needed. Iterated as I learned. Adapted as the real requirements emerged.

Scrappy. But with AI providing the professional implementation.

That's the new game. I bring the business knowledge and scrappy experimental mindset. AI brings the technical chops.

Neither of us could do it alone. Together, we ship.

## 5. Agentic AI Wants To Be Pointed, Not Programmed

Here's what I'm learning in late 2025:

The best way to work with AI isn't detailed instructions. It's direction—then let it figure out the path.

Real developers are trained to be precise. Specify everything. Leave nothing to interpretation. That's how you write code.

But that's not how you work with agentic AI.

You point. You describe the outcome. You provide context. Then you let it explore.

"I need to integrate these three systems. Here's the business logic. Here are the edge cases I know about. Figure out the best approach."

And it does. It researches the APIs. Considers different architectural approaches. Asks about tradeoffs. Then implements.

This is deeply uncomfortable for real developers. "But what if it makes the wrong choice?"

Then you adjust. Iterate. Learn together.

This is natural for scrappy hackers. We've always worked this way. Try something. See what breaks. Adapt. Ship the next version.

The difference now? The AI's doing the technical implementation. But the mindset's pure scrappy hacking.

Point, don't program. Describe outcomes, not steps. Provide context, not specifications.

Let the AI explore. Let it reason. Let it make choices.

You're the guide. The business expert. The person who knows what "good enough" looks like.

AI's the technical expert. The implementer. The one who knows the patterns.

Together, you're scrappy at scale. Experimental, but with production-grade results.

This wouldn't work with old AI. You needed to be precise or you'd get garbage.

But September 2025 changed that. Now you can be directional. Strategic. Let the AI handle tactical.

That's not programming. That's collaboration. With something that's not human, but thinks.

## 6. Multi-Agent Workflows: Scrappy Just Got Scalable

Here's the newest pattern I'm experimenting with:

Multiple AI agents working in parallel. Each one tackling a piece of a complex problem. Coordinating through shared context in the IDE.

This sounds like enterprise architecture. But it's scrappy as hell.

One agent researching API integration patterns. Another building data transformation logic. A third handling error conditions and logging. A fourth writing tests.

All simultaneously. All in the same VS Code workspace. All sharing context through files.

I'm cycling between them. Nudging each forward. Checking their reasoning. Adjusting direction.

This is impossible for a single human developer. Too much context to hold. Too many pieces to coordinate.

But it's natural for a scrappy hacker with AI collaborators.

I don't need to understand every piece. I need to understand the business problem. The integration points. The "good enough" threshold.

The agents handle the implementation. Each in their domain. All coordinated through shared context.

This is absurdly powerful. And it feels like scrappy hacking because I'm still iterating. Still adapting. Still learning as I build.

But now I'm orchestrating multiple expert AI collaborators instead of struggling alone.

A real developer would want to plan this properly first. Design the architecture. Allocate responsibilities. Coordinate formally.

I just start. Point each agent at a piece. Let them explore. Adjust as patterns emerge.

Scrappy. But at a scale that wasn't possible six months ago.

I don't need to be in all of them constantly. I check in. I adjust. I make judgment calls about which pieces need more attention.

The agents maintain their own context. Remember their own progress. Make decisions within their scope.

I'm the conductor. Not playing every instrument. Just keeping the orchestra in sync.

Last week, I built a complex reporting system this way. Four agents. Different aspects of the problem. Running in parallel IDE windows.

Research and planning agent: exploring the data sources, documenting patterns.

Data pipeline agent: building the ETL logic.

Visualization agent: creating the dashboard.

Testing agent: validating edge cases.

Me: cycling between them, checking in every 20-30 minutes, making strategic decisions, testing the integrations.

Five days. Working system. Production-deployed.

Would a real developer team do it this way? Probably not. They'd have formal handoffs. Coordinated sprints. Integration meetings.

But this worked. This shipped. This created value.

It's scrappy hacking scaled up. Multiple collaborators (AI agents). Loose coordination. Fast iteration. Ship and learn.

The breakthrough isn't the technology. It's realizing that the scrappy mindset works at scale now.

You don't need to become a "real developer." You need to become a good conductor.

Point multiple AIs in the right direction. Let them work semi-autonomously. Check in to coordinate. Make judgment calls. Ship fast.

That's the future of scrappy hacking. And honestly, it feels like where business technology was always heading.

Not perfect. Not architecturally pure. But fast, adaptive, and valuable.

## What This Means for Business Technology

I spent 15 years feeling like a second-class citizen in the technology world.

Real developers had computer science degrees. I had a business background and learned to hack.

Real developers built architecturally sound systems. I built scrappy solutions that worked.

Real developers got respect. I got "well, that's not really development."

But here's what I learned:

**For most business problems, scrappy beats perfect.**

Not because perfect isn't better. Because perfect takes too long. Costs too much. Can't adapt fast enough.

Business moves faster than enterprise IT. Always has. Always will.

The scrappy hackers who could build fast, adapt quickly, and ship constantly? We've been creating the majority of actual business value.

We just didn't get credit for it.

November 2025 changes the equation.

Now scrappy hackers can build at scrappy speed with professional-grade implementation.

We can experiment fast and ship production systems.

We can point AI agents and coordinate complex work.

We can embrace the mess of real data and build solutions that work in reality, not just in theory.

The real developers will adapt. They'll learn to work with AI. They'll bring architectural thinking to bigger problems.

But the scrappy hackers? This is our moment.

We've always known how to:
- Ship fast and iterate
- Embrace imperfection
- Work with messy reality
- Create value over elegance
- Experiment and learn

Now we have AI that handles the technical implementation. That knows the patterns. That writes clean code.

Combined with our business knowledge and scrappy mindset?

That's a competitive advantage.---

## My Advice If You're "Not a Real Developer"

If you've spent years feeling like you're not technical enough. Not a "real" developer. Just hacking things together.

Good. That's exactly the mindset you need for November 2025.

Don't try to become a real developer. Double down on being a scrappy hacker.

Learn to:
- Point AI agents toward outcomes
- Coordinate multiple AI collaborators
- Mind the data and the context
- Ship fast and iterate constantly
- Embrace good enough over perfect

The AI handles:
- Clean code structure
- Design patterns
- Best practices
- Technical implementation

You focus on:
- Business value
- Real-world complexity
- Judgment calls
- What's good enough
- What matters

That combination? That's the new competitive advantage.

Not "real development." Not "AI does everything."

Scrappy hackers collaborating with agentic AI.

Fast, adaptive, valuable.

## The Scrappy Hacker's Moment

I've been "not a real developer" for 15 years.

Built more value than I can count. Automated thousands of hours of manual work. Created systems that generated millions in revenue.

All while feeling like I wasn't doing it "right."

November 2025's when I realized: I've been doing it exactly right. Just early.

Scrappy hacking isn't a workaround for not being a real developer.

It's a legitimate strategy for business technology. Especially now.

Fast beats perfect. Adaptive beats planned. Good enough beats architected-for-the-future.

When you have AI handling the technical implementation? Scrappy becomes a superpower.

So if you're not a real developer? Join me.

Let's build scrappy, ship fast, iterate constantly, and create ridiculous amounts of value.

The real developers can keep debating architecture patterns.

We'll be shipping.

## P.S. To Real Developers Reading This

I'm not actually against you. Some of my best friends are real developers.

You bring value that scrappy hackers can't. Architectural thinking for true enterprise systems. Performance optimization at scale. Security expertise. Deep algorithmic knowledge.

But here's the thing:

Most business problems don't need that. They need fast, adaptive solutions that work in messy reality.

And increasingly, AI can provide the architectural patterns while business experts provide the judgment.

You'll adapt. You'll find your place in this new world. Probably doing even more interesting work than you do now.

But the scrappy hackers are going to build a lot more stuff. A lot faster.

Not because we're better. Because we've been training for this mindset our whole careers.

No hard feelings. See you in production.
