- Improve flow and structure
- Influences: McPhee, Moesta, Christensen, Graham

**Draft 3: Make It Tight & Human** (Clarity & Voice)
- Add 50+ contractions per 2,000 words
- Remove AI-tells ("unlock," "leverage," "game-changing")
- Add conversational markers

- Apply humanization checklist
- Influences: Zinsser, Ferriss, Sivers, Lewis
