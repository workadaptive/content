## Why WorkAdaptive?

We've made this journey.

10+ years in BI, data analytics, B2B sales/CRM operations. Worked with business users who knew what they needed but had to wait for IT.

October 2025 brought Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5. Not mid-2024 (just code completion). Not mid-2025 (Claude 4, GPT-4.x were better but frustrating—brilliant code that misunderstood intent, made string escaping errors, broke things during refactoring).

October 2025: Finally reliable. Finally understands intent. Finally doesn't make junior mistakes. Now using these models with VS Code to build solutions directly. Teaching others to do the same.

The insight: Business experts don't need to become programmers. AI handles the coding. You provide the business logic.

The architecture that makes it work: IDE + AI creates persistent working memory. Your requirements docs, configurations, tests become the AI's context. Nothing gets lost across iterations. This allows complexity that ChatGPT can't handle. Multi-file projects, system integrations, maintainable solutions. ([Deep dive on IDE + AI architecture →](_articles/why-ides-solve-ai-memory-problem.md))

The strategic advantage: Choose models for their strengths. GPT-5 for research and planning (brilliant at synthesis). Claude 4.5 for complex building (exceptional code structure, reliable refactoring).

This isn't developer productivity (making coders faster) or vibe coding (toy examples). This is business experts building business-scale solutions. ([Read the September 2025 story →](_articles/front-row-seat-to-history.md))
