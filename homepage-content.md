### Your Business Experts Can Build with AI
**No Programming Required. Just Describe What You Need.**

Stop waiting months for IT. 

Your domain experts (sales ops, finance, operations) can build real automation by describing business logic. AI handles everything else.

## Why Now?

October 2025 brought Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5—finally reliable enough for non-coders to build production systems. ([Read about what changed →](_articles/front-row-seat-to-history.md))

Context-aware AI in tools like VS Code understands your data structure, business processes, and workflows. You describe outcomes. AI builds solutions. Deploy in days, not quarters.

The difference from ChatGPT? IDEs provide persistent working memory. Your requirements, configurations, and tests become AI's context. Nothing gets lost. This enables business-scale complexity: multi-file projects, system integrations, maintainable solutions. ([Why IDEs solve AI's memory problem →](_articles/why-ides-solve-ai-memory-problem.md))

**Revenue Ops Analyst:** Pipeline health monitoring with AI-detected risk patterns. Forecast accuracy: 65%→89%. Built in 3 weeks. ([More for data analysts & BI pros →](_articles/for-data-analysts-bi-professionals.md))

These aren't developers. They're business experts who learned to describe requirements clearly to AI.

## The Problem We Solve

**You need automation but:**
• IT backlogs are 3-6 months for "simple" requests
• External developers don't understand your business
• Low-code platforms hit limitations fast
• ChatGPT feels powerful but hits complexity ceiling

**The architecture that solves this:** IDE + AI working memory + your domain expertise = complex, production-ready solutions without the translation gap.
