### Your Business Experts Can Build with AI
**No Programming Required. Just Describe What You Need.**

Stop waiting months for IT. 

Your domain experts (sales ops, finance, operations) can build real automation by describing business logic. AI handles everything else.

## Core Value Proposition

### AI + IDE: The New Way to Build Business Solutions for non-developers

**Context-aware AI in tools like VS Code understands:**
- Your data structure and systems
- Your business processes and rules
- Your existing workflows

**You describe outcomes. AI builds solutions. Deploy in days, not quarters.**

## The Urgency: Why Now?

Agentic AI is reshaping business from the inside out.

Something fundamental shifted in October 2025. Not mid-2024 (that was just code completion). Not even mid-2025 (Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4.x were better but messy - like asking a brilliant PhD to write code who constantly misunderstood intent and made junior mistakes).

October 2025 brought Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5. Finally reliable enough for non-coders. Finally understands intent. Finally doesn't break working code during refactoring. Combined with VS Code improvements, this is the breakthrough moment.

Your competitors aren't waiting. Right now, they're:
- Automating processes you're still doing manually (using Claude 4.5 for complex logic)
- Making decisions faster with AI-powered intelligence (using GPT-5 for analysis)
- Building capabilities you're still trying to hire for (combining models strategically)

**Now is not the time to:**
- ❌ Wait and see what happens
- ❌ Rely solely on IT capacity that can't keep pace
- ❌ Assume AI is just hype or someone else's problem
- ❌ Let "we'll get to it next quarter" become "we're too far behind"

The window is open right now. But it's closing fast.

Companies building AI capabilities with Claude 4.5 and GPT-5 now gain 6-12 months advantage. Those waiting will be playing catch-up while competitors pull further ahead.

## What's Actually Possible Today

Real examples of what business experts are building:

**Sales Operations Manager** (no coding background):
- AI agent monitors all new leads, enriches data from 10+ sources
- Scores based on your actual win patterns
- Routes to right rep with full context
- Continuously updates as engagement changes
- Built in 3 weeks. Saved 200+ hours/month.

**Finance Controller** (Excel/Power BI user):
- Automated month-end close workflow
- Pulls from 5 different systems, applies reconciliation rules
- Flags exceptions, generates executive summary
- What took 3 days now takes 3 hours
- Built in 2 weeks. 40-hour monthly savings.

**Operations Manager** (manufacturing):
- Production data integration from ERP, MES, quality systems
- Real-time alerts when margins drop or issues arise
- Automated daily reports to stakeholders
- Caught problems 3 weeks earlier than manual review
- Built in 4 weeks. Saved $200K first quarter.

**Revenue Operations Analyst** (CRM admin):
- Pipeline health monitoring across all deals
- AI detects at-risk patterns from email, calls, engagement
- Automated weekly forecast with confidence scores
- Forecast accuracy jumped from 65% to 89%
- Built in 3 weeks. $800K better forecasting.

These aren't developers. They're business experts with domain knowledge who learned to describe requirements clearly to AI.

## Problem We Solve

**You need automation but...**
• IT backlogs are 3-6 months for "simple" requests
• External developers don't understand your business
• Low-code platforms hit limitations fast
• ChatGPT feels powerful but hits complexity ceiling fast

**The translation gap:** Your domain experts know what's needed, developers know how to build, but the handoff loses critical business context.

**The ChatGPT problem:** Great for one-off scripts. Fails for multi-system integrations, maintainable solutions, anything requiring persistent context across iterations.

**The architecture that solves this:** IDE + AI working memory + your domain expertise = complex, production-ready solutions without the translation gap.

---

## Our Approach

We enable business experts to build solutions using AI and developer-grade tools. Without learning to code.

This isn't about making developers faster or "vibe coding" toy examples.

This is about the architectural sweet spot where:
- **You provide:** Business knowledge, planning, requirements (what you're already expert at)
- **AI provides:** Technical implementation, syntax, integration code
- **IDE provides:** Working memory that makes complex, maintainable solutions possible

The breakthrough in October 2025: Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 finally reliable enough for non-coders. Earlier models (mid-2024: just code completion; mid-2025: brilliant but frustrating) weren't ready. Now they are.

The difference? While ChatGPT loses context across conversations, IDE-based AI (like VS Code + Copilot with Claude 4.5/GPT-5) sees your entire project. Files, configurations, business rules, documentation. Nothing gets lost. Progress compounds.

You can also choose models strategically: GPT-5 for research and planning, Claude 4.5 for building complex systems. Each model for its unique strengths.

This makes business-scale complexity feasible for non-developers. Right now.

## About Ian Bowman

Founded WorkAdaptive doing data analytics and Power BI consulting. Spent 10+ years with business users who knew exactly what automation they needed but had to wait months for IT.

AI changed the equation in October 2025. Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 finally made it possible for business experts to describe requirements and get working solutions. Earlier attempts (2024-early 2025) were promising but frustrating. Now it actually works.

Your domain knowledge becomes the differentiator. AI handles the technical implementation.

Current focus: Helping CEOs, CIOs, and business leaders enable their teams to build AI-powered solutions using Claude 4.5, GPT-5, and modern IDEs like VS Code. Without massive IT investments or development teams.
