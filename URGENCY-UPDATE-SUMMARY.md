## Competitive Positioning

### **Against "Wait and See" Mentality:**
- "By the time it's 'proven,' competitors have 18-month head starts"
- "The companies dominating in 2027 are making this decision in November 2025"
- "Every month delayed = more ground to make up"

### **Against Traditional IT Approaches:**
- "6-month projects vs. 3-week solutions"
- "$150K development vs. $12K enablement"
- "IT dependency vs. business autonomy"

### **Against Low-Code Platforms:**
- "Platform limitations vs. unlimited flexibility"
- "Vendor lock-in vs. standard tools"
- "More tools to learn vs. leveraging AI to build"
