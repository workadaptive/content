# Editorial Process Example: Power BI Professionals Article

*Applying the Three-Draft Process to a real article*

## What We're Demonstrating

This document shows how to apply the three-draft editorial process to "For Power BI Professionals" article using our style influences.

---

## Current State Assessment

**Draft stage:** Between Draft 1 and Draft 2
- Good ideas are present
- Some structure exists
- But needs tightening significantly

**Word count:** ~8,500 words
**Target:** 5,000-6,000 words (cut 30%)

**Issues identified:**

1. **Redundancy** - "Unfair advantage" made 3-4 times
2. **Throat-clearing** - Setup before getting to points
3. **Structure** - Some sections in wrong order
4. **Repetition** - Lists that say the same thing twice
5. **Length** - Some sections belabor the point

## Section-by-Section Editorial Analysis

### Opening (Lines 1-12)

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
You've spent years mastering Power BI. DAX formulas. Data modeling. Star schemas. Relationships and cardinality. Measure optimization.

You're good at what you do. But you're also seeing the writing on the wall.

AI is coming for knowledge work. And you're wondering: "Is my Power BI expertise about to become obsolete?"

Here's the counterintuitive answer: **Your Power BI experience is about to become dramatically more valuable.**

But only if you make a move in the next 6-12 months.

Let me explain why, and show you exactly what to do.
```

**AFTER (applying Zinsser cut + Sivers lead with insight):**
```markdown
You've spent years mastering Power BI. DAX formulas. Data modeling. Star schemas. Measure optimization.

You're good at what you do. But you're watching AI arrive for knowledge work and wondering: "Is my Power BI expertise about to become obsolete?"

Here's the counterintuitive answer: **Your Power BI experience just became dramatically more valuable.**

But only if you make a move in the next 6-12 months.

Here's why, and exactly what to do.
```

**What changed:**
- Cut "Relationships and cardinality" (redundant with data modeling)
- Cut "also seeing the writing on the wall" (implied)
- Cut "AI is coming for" (already in "you're wondering")
- Cut "Let me explain why" (just say "Here's why")

**Result:** 77 words → 58 words (25% cut, no meaning lost)

**Style influences applied:**
- ✅ Zinsser: Cut what doesn't serve
- ✅ Sivers: Lead with insight
- ✅ Ferriss: Second person, actionable frame

---

### First Major Section (Lines 14-27)

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
## Why Power BI Professionals Have An Unfair Advantage

Most people trying to learn AI + development are starting from zero.

They don't understand data modeling. They've never worked with complex business logic. They don't know what a fact table is or why relationships matter.

You know all of this. Deeply.

And here's what I've discovered over the last few months: **Data modeling knowledge translates directly to working with AI in IDEs.**

But here's the part that nobody's talking about: **Power BI Desktop is already kind of an IDE.**
```

**AFTER (applying McPhee structure + Zinsser cut):**
```markdown
## Power BI Desktop Is Already an IDE (You Just Didn't Call It That)

Most people trying to learn AI + development are starting from zero. They don't understand data modeling, complex business logic, or why relationships matter.

You know all of this. Deeply.

Here's what nobody's talking about: **Power BI Desktop already functions as an IDE.**
```

**What changed:**
- Header now leads with the insight (not the setup)
- Cut the throat-clearing ("And here's what I've discovered")
- Cut "already kind of an IDE" replaced with "already functions as an IDE" (stronger)
- Removed the wind-up ("But here's the part that nobody's talking about")
- Combined sentences for better flow

**Result:** 85 words → 46 words (46% cut!)

**Style influences applied:**
- ✅ Sivers: Lead with insight in header
- ✅ Zinsser: Strip throat-clearing
- ✅ McPhee: Structure reveals meaning

---

### The Comparison Table Section (Lines 29-77)

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
Think about it:

[Table with 7 rows comparing Power BI to VS Code]

You're already working in an IDE. You just didn't call it that.

The transition to VS Code isn't learning something completely foreign. It's expanding a paradigm you already understand.

**What you do in Power BI:**
- Design data models with relationships and context
- Write DAX measures that reference other measures
- Handle filter context and calculate context
- Optimize for performance as models grow
- Deal with messy real-world data
- Translate business requirements into working logic
- Debug formulas that aren't working
- Refactor measures as requirements evolve

**What you'll do with AI in VS Code:**
- Design data structures with relationships and context (same thing)
- Write logic that references other logic (same thing)
- Handle data context and scope (same thing)
- Optimize for performance as systems grow (same thing)
- Deal with messy real-world data (same thing)
- Translate business requirements into working logic (SAME THING)
- Debug code that isn't working (same thing)
- Refactor solutions as requirements evolve (same thing)

The only difference? AI helps you write the syntax. You're still doing the same cognitive work.

**This is not about becoming a developer.**

This is about extending business and data skills you've already mastered.

You already understand:
- How to think about data structure
- How to break down complex business logic
- How to test and validate results
- How to optimize for performance
- How to handle edge cases and errors
- How to document your work
- How to iterate based on feedback

That's 90% of what you need. AI provides the missing 10% (syntax and implementation patterns).

You're not starting from scratch. You're already 60% there.

You just need to make the leap. And November 2025 is the perfect time to do it.
```

**AFTER (applying Zinsser ruthless cutting + Ferriss scannable):**
```markdown
[Table with 7 rows - KEEP AS IS, it's perfect]

The transition to VS Code isn't learning something foreign. It's expanding a paradigm you already understand.

**You're not starting from scratch. You're already 60% there.**

The skills transfer directly:

- Design data models → Design data structures (same cognitive work)
- Write DAX that references other measures → Write logic that references other logic
- Handle filter and calculate context → Handle data context and scope  
- Optimize as models grow → Optimize as systems grow
- Work with messy real-world data → Still messy real-world data
- Translate business requirements → Still translating business requirements
- Debug formulas → Debug code
- Refactor as requirements evolve → Still refactoring

**The only difference?** AI helps you write the syntax. You're still doing the thinking.

This is not about becoming a developer. This is about extending skills you've already mastered.
```

**What changed:**
- Cut "Think about it:" (unnecessary setup)
- Cut "You're already working in an IDE. You just didn't call it that." (redundant with header)
- Merged two bullet lists into one parallel structure (much cleaner)
- Cut the second "You already understand:" list (same information, different words)
- Cut "90% / 10%" stat (feels made up, weakens authority)
- Cut "You just need to make the leap. And November 2025..." (will address timing later)
- Made bullets parallel and tighter (Ferriss scannable)

**Result:** 340 words → 150 words (56% cut!)

**Style influences applied:**
- ✅ Zinsser: Ruthless cutting of redundancy
- ✅ Ferriss: Scannable parallel structure
- ✅ Sivers: Shorter than you think necessary
- ✅ Lewis: Rhythm through varied sentence length

## Key Editorial Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Cut Throat-Clearing
**Before:** "And here's what I've discovered over the last few months:"
**After:** [Just state it]

**Why:** Zinsser - readers don't need the setup, they need the insight

### 2. Merge Redundant Lists
**Before:** Two separate 8-item lists saying the same thing
**After:** One 8-item parallel list

**Why:** Saying it twice doesn't make it more convincing, just longer

### 3. Lead With The Insight
**Before:** Header = "Why Power BI Professionals Have An Unfair Advantage"
**After:** Header = "Power BI Desktop Is Already an IDE"

**Why:** Sivers - the insight IS the hook

### 4. Tighten Parallel Structure
**Before:** "Design data models with relationships and context" vs "Design data structures with relationships and context (same thing)"
**After:** "Design data models → Design data structures (same cognitive work)"

**Why:** Ferriss - scannable structure reveals pattern instantly

### 5. Cut Made-Up Stats
**Before:** "That's 90% of what you need. AI provides the missing 10%"
**After:** [Cut]

**Why:** Christensen - don't weaken authority with unprovable precision

### 6. Eliminate "Same Thing" Repetition
**Before:** "(same thing)" repeated 8 times
**After:** One statement at the end

**Why:** Trust the reader to see the pattern (Lewis, Zinsser)

## Full Article Editorial Roadmap

If we were to complete this editorial pass on the entire article, here's what I'd recommend:

### Section-by-Section Cuts:

**✂️ Two Paths Forward** (Lines 87-96)
- Current: 85 words setting up the two paths
- Target: 30 words
- Cut: "I'm going to recommend something counterintuitive" (just recommend it)

**✂️ Common Objections** (Lines 512-635)
- Current: ~1,500 words  
- Target: 800 words (45% cut)
- Keep: The "IDE gag reflex" section (this is GOLD - real quotes, funny, human)
- Cut: Short responses to obvious objections
- Better: Address 3-4 real objections deeply vs 8 superficially

**✂️ Your Next Step** (Lines 637-720)
- Current: ~1,000 words

## What Makes This Article Strong (Don't Cut)

### ✅ The IDE Comparison Table
Perfect. Visual. Instant clarity. McPhee would approve - structure reveals meaning.

### ✅ The Three Project Examples  
Real, specific, valuable. Moesta would approve - customer stories with context.

### ✅ The "IDE Gag Reflex" Section
Hilarious real quotes. Human. Vulnerable. This is Anne Lamott permission-giving at its best.

### ✅ The Four Power BI Patterns
Specific, technical, valuable. This is practitioner credibility (Ferriss).

### ✅ The BI to AI Cohort Offering
ROI breakdown is thorough but not over-sold. Good balance.

## Editorial Time Investment

**Full article edit following this approach:**

- Section-by-section clarity pass: 90 minutes
- Structural reordering: 30 minutes  
- Voice consistency pass: 45 minutes
- Final read-aloud + polish: 30 minutes

**Total: ~3 hours for draft 3 editorial pass**

**Result:**
- 8,500 words → 5,500 words (35% cut)
- Stronger opening
- Clearer structure
- More scannable
- Voice consistency
- Ready to publish

---

## Key Takeaways From This Example

### 1. Cut Percentage Varies By Section
- Opening: 25% cut
- Setup sections: 40-50% cut
- Example/story sections: 15-20% cut
- Technical how-to: 30% cut

### 2. The Best Parts Need Least Editing
"IDE gag reflex" section barely needs touching. It's already tight, human, funny. Trust what's working.

### 3. Redundancy Is The Biggest Opportunity
Saying the same thing 3 ways doesn't triple impact. Pick the best version, cut the rest.

### 4. Structure Problems Reveal Themselves
When you find yourself explaining the same point in three different sections, that's a structure problem. Reorganize, don't repeat.

### 5. Headers Should Lead With Insight
"Why X Matters" → "X Is Already Y" (insight in the header itself)

### 6. Trust The Reader More
You don't need to say "Here's what I mean" or "Let me explain" - just explain.

### 7. Made-Up Precision Weakens Authority
"90% / 10%" "4x to 12x ROI" - unless you can back it up, cut it or make it approximate.

### 8. Real Quotes Are Gold
Those "IDE gag reflex" quotes? Keep every one. They're specific, human, funny, and true.

## How To Apply This To Your Own Work

### Step 1: Identify Your Gold
Read through. Find the sections that make you think "this is good." Protect those.

### Step 2: Find The Redundancy
Where did you say the same thing twice? Three times? Pick the best version.

### Step 3: Cut Throat-Clearing
"Here's what I mean" "Let me explain" "This is important" - cut these, just say it.

### Step 4: Check Your Lists
Two lists saying the same thing? Merge them. Bullet points that ramble? Tighten to parallel structure.

### Step 5: Headers As Insights
Can your section header be the insight itself? Try rewriting it that way.

### Step 6: Read Aloud
Where do you stumble? That's where it needs cutting or rewriting.

### Step 7: Apply The 20% Test
Pick any section. Cut 20%. Is it worse? If not, keep cutting.

## Next Steps For This Article

**Option A: Complete the full editorial pass**
Apply this approach to every section. 3 hours of focused editing. Result: publication-ready.

**Option B: Selective editing**
Edit the opening + two weakest sections. Leave the strong sections alone. 90 minutes. Result: good enough to ship.

**Option C: Ship as-is with minor fixes**
Fix the duplicate line, tighten the opening, add paragraph breaks for readability. 30 minutes. Result: shippable but not optimized.

**My recommendation:** Option B. 

The article is already good. The opening needs tightening (done above). The objections section and learning path section need cuts. The rest is solid.

90 minutes of targeted editing > 3 hours of perfectionism.

Ship it. Move to the next piece. Compound the wins.
