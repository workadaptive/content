        <p class="tagline">No Programming Required. Just Describe What You Need.</p>
        <p>Stop waiting months for IT. Your domain experts (sales ops, finance, operations) can build real automation by describing business logic. AI handles everything else.</p>

        <h2>Why Now?</h2>
        <p>October 2025 brought Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5—finally reliable enough for non-coders to build production systems. <a href="{{ '/_articles/front-row-seat-to-history.html' | relative_url }}">Read about what changed →</a></p>
        
        <p>Context-aware AI in tools like VS Code understands your data structure, business processes, and workflows. You describe outcomes. AI builds solutions. Deploy in days, not quarters.</p>
        
        <p>The difference from ChatGPT? IDEs provide persistent working memory. Your requirements, configurations, and tests become AI's context. Nothing gets lost. This enables business-scale complexity: multi-file projects, system integrations, maintainable solutions. <a href="{{ '/_articles/why-ides-solve-ai-memory-problem.html' | relative_url }}">Why IDEs solve AI's memory problem →</a></p>

<section class="problem">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
        <p><strong>You need automation but:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>IT backlogs are 3-6 months for "simple" requests</li>
            <li>External developers don't understand your business</li>
            <li>Low-code platforms hit limitations fast</li>
            <li>ChatGPT feels powerful but hits complexity ceiling</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The architecture that solves this:</strong> IDE + AI working memory + your domain expertise = complex, production-ready solutions without the translation gap.</p>
