# Draft 3: Voice Pass Checklist

**Purpose:** Transform structurally-sound draft into tight, human-sounding piece ready to publish.

**When to use:** After Draft 2 (structure is locked, content is solid, but prose is still rough/AI-ish/too long)

**Time estimate:** 45-60 minutes for ~2,000 word piece

**Process:** Work through each section systematically. Check every box before moving to next section.

---

## SECTION 1: CLARITY PASS (Zinsser)

**Goal:** Strip waste, strengthen sentences, make every word earn its place.

### 1.1 Cut Redundancy
- [ ] Find places where same point is made multiple times → keep best version, delete others
- [ ] Look for "said another way" constructions → pick one way, delete the other
- [ ] Check conclusions that just restate what was already clear → cut them

### 1.2 Remove Throat-Clearing
Eliminate these openings:
- [ ] "It's worth noting that..."
- [ ] "One could argue that..."
- [ ] "In today's world..."
- [ ] "Importantly," / "Notably," / "Essentially,"
- [ ] "To be clear," (unless truly necessary for disambiguation)
- [ ] "What's interesting is..."

### 1.3 Strengthen Verbs
Replace weak verb + adverb with strong verb:
- [ ] "very important" → "critical" / "essential"
- [ ] "really helped" → "accelerated" / "enabled" / "transformed"
- [ ] "quickly moved" → "rushed" / "sprinted" / "darted"
- [ ] "significantly increased" → "doubled" / "tripled" (use specific numbers when possible)

### 1.4 Active Voice (Default)
- [ ] Change passive to active unless passive serves a purpose
  - ❌ "The solution was built by the team"
  - ✅ "The team built the solution"
  - ✅ "The solution was deployed" (passive OK when actor doesn't matter)

### 1.5 Read Aloud Test
- [ ] Read entire piece aloud (or use text-to-speech)
- [ ] Mark any sentence that makes you stumble
- [ ] Rewrite stumble points until they flow smoothly

### 1.6 The 20% Cut Test
- [ ] Can you cut 20% without losing meaning? If yes, do it.
- [ ] If you cut 20% and it's now too sparse, add back 10%
- [ ] Better too tight than too bloated

**CHECKPOINT:** After Clarity Pass, piece should be tighter, clearer, easier to read. If not, repeat this section.

---

## SECTION 2: VOICE PASS (The Humanization Core)

**Goal:** Remove AI-tells, add personality, make it sound like you wrote it (not a robot).

### 2.1 Remove AI-Generic Language

Search and destroy these phrases:
- [ ] "unlock" (potential, value, capabilities) → use "create," "enable," "build"
- [ ] "leverage" → use "use"
- [ ] "game-changing" → be specific about what changes
- [ ] "transformational" → show the transformation, don't label it
- [ ] "cutting-edge" → just describe what it does
- [ ] "innovative" / "innovation" → unless quoting Christensen framework
- [ ] "ecosystem" → unless literally discussing biology or actual platform ecosystems
- [ ] "synergy" → never
- [ ] "paradigm shift" → rarely justified, be specific instead
- [ ] "holistic" → usually meaningless
- [ ] "robust" → use "reliable," "proven," "battle-tested"

### 2.2 Add Contractions (Target: 50+ per ~2,000 words)

Replace formal with casual:
- [ ] "you are" → "you're"
- [ ] "it is" → "it's"
- [ ] "that is" → "that's"
- [ ] "do not" → "don't"
- [ ] "cannot" → "can't"
- [ ] "I have" → "I've"
- [ ] "they will" → "they'll"
- [ ] "would not" → "wouldn't"
- [ ] "should not" → "shouldn't"

Exception: Keep formal when emphasis matters ("You are the one who decides" is stronger than "You're the one who decides")

### 2.3 Add Conversational Markers

Insert these where natural (don't force):
- [ ] "Here's what's wild:"
- [ ] "Let me show you"
- [ ] "Here's the thing"
- [ ] "And here's why that matters"
- [ ] "Look at this"
- [ ] "Think about it"
- [ ] "Here's what I mean"
- [ ] "Let me be clear"
- [ ] "Here's what gets me"
- [ ] "Watch what happens"

### 2.4 Conversational Test

For each paragraph:
- [ ] Would you actually say this to someone? If not, rewrite
- [ ] Read it aloud - does it sound like you talking? Adjust until it does
- [ ] If a sentence feels "written" rather than "spoken," simplify it

### 2.5 Vary Sentence Length

Count sentences in each paragraph. Check pattern:
- [ ] Short sentences (5-10 words) for punch and emphasis
- [ ] Medium sentences (12-20 words) for flow and explanation
- [ ] Occasional long sentences (25+ words) for building complexity
- [ ] Avoid: All short (choppy) or all long (exhausting)

**Good rhythm example:**
> "This is real. This is happening. Right now. Business experts can build production systems by describing requirements in plain language, without coding backgrounds, using AI that understands intent and generates clean code. This isn't theoretical, this isn't coming soon, this is September 2025."
(Short. Short. Two words. Long sentence building. Long sentence contrasting. Short punch.)

### 2.6 Add Personal Perspective

Look for opportunities to add:
- [ ] "I've seen..." (your direct observation)
- [ ] "In my experience..." (pattern you've noticed)
- [ ] "Last month I..." (specific recent example)
- [ ] "A client recently..." (real story, can anonymize)
- [ ] "When I first..." (your journey/learning)

### 2.7 Real People Language (Moesta)

For any quoted or described customer/user:
- [ ] Use their actual words (not cleaned up)
- [ ] Include their specific details (not generic)
- [ ] Keep their emotion/frustration/excitement
- [ ] Let contradictions show (real people contradict themselves)

**Bad:** "Users found the system helpful"
**Good:** "One ops manager told me: 'I kept waiting for it to break or misunderstand something fundamental. But it never did.'"

### 2.8 Imperfect Phrasing (Strategic)

Occasionally include slightly imperfect phrasing (shows human wrote this):
- [ ] "And here's the thing" (starts with And)
- [ ] Sentence fragments for emphasis. Like this.
- [ ] Repetition for effect: "Real things. Real examples. Real results."
- [ ] Parentheticals (like this one) mid-sentence
- [ ] Em dashes—for insertions—that break flow intentionally

Don't overdo this. Maybe 3-5 instances per 2,000 words.

### 2.9 Direct Address

Make sure you're talking TO the reader:
- [ ] Use "you" frequently (not "one might" or "people can")
- [ ] Ask rhetorical questions: "What does this mean for you?"
- [ ] Give direct instructions: "Try this"
- [ ] Invite action: "Let me show you"

### 2.10 Add Rhetorical Questions

Sprinkle these throughout (target: 5-10 per article):
- [ ] To transition: "So what changed?"
- [ ] To emphasize: "Why does this matter?"
- [ ] To engage: "Sound familiar?"
- [ ] To challenge: "But is it enough?"
- [ ] To introduce: "What if I told you...?"

### 2.11 Meta-Commentary

Include occasional "thinking about the writing" moments:
- [ ] "Let me be clear about something"
- [ ] "Here's what I'm getting at"
- [ ] "You might be wondering..."
- [ ] "Before you object that..."
- [ ] "I know how this sounds, but..."

**CHECKPOINT:** After Voice Pass, piece should sound like you talking to a colleague, not an AI writing a report. Read 3 random paragraphs aloud. If they sound robotic, repeat this section.

---

## SECTION 3: UTILITY PASS (Ferriss)

**Goal:** Make sure readers can DO something with this.

### 3.1 Actionable Specificity
- [ ] Replace vague advice with specific steps
  - ❌ "Use better prompts"
  - ✅ "Start your prompt with: 'Based on the DESIGN.md in this workspace...'"
- [ ] Add timeframes: not "eventually" but "within 3 weeks"
- [ ] Add quantities: not "some experiments" but "5-10 experiments over 2 weeks"

### 3.2 Clear Next Steps
- [ ] Does the ending tell readers exactly what to do next?
- [ ] Is there a clear CTA (call-to-action)?
- [ ] Have you made it easy to take the next step?

### 3.3 Scannability
- [ ] Bold key phrases (2-3 per section)
- [ ] Use bullets for lists (not prose paragraphs)
- [ ] Break up long paragraphs (>6 lines)
- [ ] Add subheads every 3-5 paragraphs

### 3.4 Section Headers as Value Signals
Review all headers:
- [ ] Do they tell readers what they'll get?
  - ❌ "Phase 1"
  - ✅ "Phase 1: Research (Building Shared Context)"
- [ ] Can someone skim headers and get the story?

**CHECKPOINT:** After Utility Pass, someone should be able to skim headers, read conclusion, and know exactly what to do. If not, strengthen this section.

---

## SECTION 4: FINAL CHECKS

**Goal:** Catch any remaining issues before publishing.

### 4.1 Opening Hook
- [ ] Does first paragraph make you want to keep reading?
- [ ] Does it establish stakes (why this matters)?
- [ ] Does it promise value (what reader will get)?

### 4.2 Examples & Evidence
- [ ] Are examples specific? (Not "a company" but "manufacturing company, 200 employees")
- [ ] Are quotes real? (Actual customer words, not synthesized)
- [ ] Are numbers used? (Not "significant improvement" but "35% faster")

### 4.3 Flow & Transitions
- [ ] Does each section connect to the next?
- [ ] Are there jarring topic jumps? Add transitions if yes.
- [ ] Does the piece build to something?

### 4.4 Ending Strength
- [ ] Does it end with implication, action, or invitation?
- [ ] Does it avoid just restating what was already said?
- [ ] Does it give reader clear next step?

### 4.5 Voice Consistency Check
Pick 3 random paragraphs:
- [ ] Do they all sound like the same person wrote them?
- [ ] Is tone consistent (not overly formal in one section, too casual in another)?
- [ ] Does it sound like YOUR voice throughout?

### 4.6 Final Read-Through
- [ ] Read entire piece start to finish
- [ ] Mark anything that feels off
- [ ] Fix marked sections
- [ ] Read those sections again to confirm

**CHECKPOINT:** After Final Checks, piece should be ready to publish. If you're hesitating, something's still off. Go back and find it.

## DONE CRITERIA

You're finished when you can check ALL these boxes:

- [ ] **Clarity:** Could read this aloud smoothly, no stumbles
- [ ] **Tight:** Cut at least 15-20% from Draft 2
- [ ] **Human:** Sounds like you talking, not AI writing
- [ ] **Specific:** Examples are concrete, numbers are used
- [ ] **Actionable:** Reader knows exactly what to do next
- [ ] **Engaging:** You'd keep reading this if you weren't the author

If all boxes checked: **SHIP IT.**

If not: Identify which section needs more work and repeat that section.

---

## COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### "This still sounds like AI wrote it"
→ Repeat Section 2 (Voice Pass)
→ Add more contractions (target 50+)
→ Read aloud and rewrite anything that sounds robotic
→ Add personal perspective ("I've seen...")

### "This is too long"
→ Repeat Section 1.6 (20% Cut Test)
→ Remove entire paragraphs that don't serve the thesis
→ Combine related points
→ Use Derek Sivers test: Can this be half as long?

### "This doesn't sound like me"
→ Compare to Draft 1 (your raw voice is there)
→ Revert any sections that lost your voice
→ Add more conversational markers
→ Record yourself explaining the point, transcribe, use that language

### "The structure feels off"
→ This shouldn't happen in Draft 3 (structure was Draft 2)
→ If it's really wrong, go back to Draft 2
→ If it's just transitions, add connecting sentences between sections

### "The ending feels weak"
→ Repeat Section 4.4
→ Add clear implication: "This means X"
→ Add clear invitation: "Try Y"
→ Or: Return to opening image (McPhee technique)

## EXAMPLE: BEFORE & AFTER

### Before (AI-ish, too formal):

> "The implementation of artificial intelligence capabilities in integrated development environments has fundamentally transformed the landscape of software development. Organizations that leverage these cutting-edge technologies can unlock significant value by enabling non-technical business experts to build robust solutions. This paradigm shift represents a game-changing opportunity for enterprises seeking to innovate at scale."

**Problems:**
- No contractions
- AI-generic language (leverage, unlock, cutting-edge, robust, paradigm shift, game-changing)
- Passive voice
- Corporate jargon
- Too formal
- No personality

### After (Human, conversational):

> "Here's what changed in September 2025: Business experts can now build real solutions. Not 'sort a CSV file' scripts. Real automation that integrates five systems, handles messy data, and runs in production. You don't need to become a developer. You just need AI in your IDE. And you need to know it's possible."

**What improved:**
- Contractions (don't, you're implied)
- Conversational markers ("Here's what changed")
- Active voice
- Specific examples
- Direct address ("you")
- Short punchy sentences
- Sounds like a person talking

## TIME TRACKING

For typical ~2,000 word article:

- Section 1 (Clarity): 15-20 minutes
- Section 2 (Voice): 20-25 minutes
- Section 3 (Utility): 5-10 minutes
- Section 4 (Final): 5-10 minutes

**Total: 45-60 minutes**

If taking longer:
- You might be doing Draft 2 work (structure) in Draft 3 (voice)
- Draft 2 wasn't complete → go back and finish it first
- You're overthinking → trust the checklist, work systematically

---

## TOOLS TO HELP

### For Finding Issues:
- **Read aloud** (best tool)
- **Text-to-speech** (catches awkwardness)
- **Search for AI-tells** (Ctrl+F: "unlock," "leverage," etc.)
- **Contraction counter** (should find 40-60 in 2,000 words)

### For Validation:
- **Would-I-say-this test** (for each paragraph)
- **Random paragraph check** (pick 3, check voice consistency)
- **Skim headers test** (can you get the story from headers alone?)

---

## VERSION CONTROL

Track your drafts:
- `article-name-draft-1.md` - Raw thinking
- `article-name-draft-2.md` - Structured
- `article-name-draft-3.md` - Voice-passed
- `article-name-final.md` - Published version

This lets you:
- Compare before/after
- Learn what changes worked
- Revert if you over-edited
- Build intuition for what "done" looks like

---

## LEARNING FROM YOUR EDITS

After finishing, spend 5 minutes reflecting:

- [ ] What type of edits did you make most? (That's your weak spot to watch for)
- [ ] Which section took longest? (Might need more practice on that skill)
- [ ] What AI-tells did you find most often? (Add to your watch-list)
- [ ] Did voice improve or get worse through edits? (Know when to stop)

**Pattern you might notice:**
- Early articles: Heavy edits in all sections
- After 5-10 articles: Mainly Section 2 (Voice) edits
- After 20+ articles: Quick pass, fewer changes needed
- Eventually: Writing Draft 2 that needs minimal Draft 3 work

**Goal:** Internalize this checklist so your Draft 2 already has good voice.
