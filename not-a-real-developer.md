# Not a Real Developer (And Why That's Been My Advantage)

I have a long history of being "not a real developer."

And I've created a ton of value - often more value - in digital systems through scrappy hacking.

This used to bother me. I'd look at computer science grads with their algorithmic knowledge and design patterns. Real developers who could architect enterprise systems and debate the merits of microservices vs. monoliths.

I couldn't do that. Still can't, really.

But over 15+ years, I've built systems that generated millions in value. Automated processes that saved thousands of hours. Created dashboards and pipelines and integrations that became mission-critical to businesses.

Not through "real development." Through scrappy hacking.

And now, in November 2025, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5, scrappy hacking just became a legitimate competitive strategy.

Let me explain why.

## 1. Sometimes the "Real Developer" Way Is Just Too Heavy

Here's what happens with formal development:

You have an idea. A process that could be automated. A new capability that might unlock revenue.

The "right" way to do this:
- Write a business case
- Get budget approval
- Hire developers or contract a firm
- Gather formal requirements
- Design the architecture
- Build in sprints
- Test extensively
- Deploy with change management

Timeline: 9-18 months  
Cost: $150K-$500K  
Risk: By the time it launches, the need has changed

And if it's a new product or process? You don't even have good data for the business case. You're guessing. Competing against proven incumbent systems for budget. Fighting for resources.

So what happens? Nothing. The idea dies in planning.

But startups don't work this way. Lean methodology doesn't work this way.

They experiment. They hack. They build scrappy MVPs. They launch fast, learn, iterate.

You know what that is? Scrappy hacking.

I've built things in Power BI that "weren't designed for that." Mashed up data sources that shouldn't technically work together. Created Excel-based workflows that processed millions in transactions.

Was it elegant? No. Would a real developer cringe? Probably.

Did it work? Did it create value? Did it let the business experiment and learn?

Yes. Yes. And yes.

That's been my career. Building scrappy solutions that let businesses move at experiment-speed rather than enterprise-IT-speed.

## 2. Architectural Bloat Is Real (We Just Don't Have A Name For It Yet)

Real developers architect for the future.

"Let's build this to scale to 10x usage."  
"Let's make this modular so we can swap out components later."  
"Let's abstract this so it can handle any future requirement."

It's not wrong. It's professional. It's what you're supposed to do.

But here's what I know from 15 years of building scrappy systems:

**80% of what we build will be obsolete or rebuilt in less than 3 years.**

Not because it's bad. Because business processes change that fast. Or the scale changes. Or the technology landscape shifts. Or the business priority pivots.

I've watched companies spend 18 months architecting perfect systems that were obsolete before they launched because the market shifted.

Meanwhile, I've built hacky solutions in 3 weeks that ran for years. Some for decades.

The ones that lasted weren't architecturally perfect. They lasted because:
- They solved a real problem
- They were simple enough to maintain
- They adapted as the business changed
- They created enough value that people protected them

I'm not saying architecture doesn't matter. For true enterprise systems serving thousands of users with high uptime requirements, you need real developers doing real architecture.

But for most mid-market business automation? For new processes? For experimental capabilities?

Scrappy beats perfect. Every time.

Because scrappy ships in weeks and adapts as it learns. Perfect ships in quarters and ossifies.

We don't have a term for "architectural bloat." But I've seen it. Building for every possible future requirement. Making it modular and abstract and flexible.

Until it's so complex that nobody understands it. So generalized that simple changes take weeks. So "perfect" that adapting to actual business needs requires architectural debates.

My hacky solutions? They're concrete. They do one thing. They're understandable. They change fast.

That's not a bug. That's a feature.

## 3. Mind the Data and the Context

Development is logic-based. Pure. Beautiful, if you like that sort of thing.

Data is messy. Like all of us who create it.

People who love pure logic often hate messy data. Null values that shouldn't exist. Dates formatted three different ways. Business rules with exceptions to the exceptions.

But very few valuable things happen without data.

So lean into the data. Embrace the mess.

This has been my secret weapon. I'm not great at elegant code. But I'm really good at understanding messy data.

Where it comes from. Why it's inconsistent. What the business rules actually are (versus what people think they are). How to reconcile systems that were never designed to talk to each other.

Real developers want to fix the data first. Normalize it. Clean it at the source. Design proper schemas.

I work with what I have. Right now. Imperfect.

I build pipelines that handle the mess. That expect inconsistency. That adapt to reality rather than waiting for reality to be fixed.

And here's what's wild about November 2025:

There's a whole new kind of data we can work with. Text. Audio. Video.

Incredibly valuable types of data. And increasingly, data about logic itself.

I'm starting to pair traditional rows and columns and formulas with unstructured text data. Requirements documents as data sources. Email threads as business logic. Meeting transcripts as specifications.

This would be impossible for a traditional developer mindset. "First, let's structure this data properly."

But with AI? The AI reads the messy text. Understands the intent. Generates the structured logic.

My job is to mind the data. Understand the context. Know where the edge cases hide in real-world mess.

AI handles the clean implementation.

It's scrappy hacking at a whole new level.

## 4. The AI Knows Patterns I Don't (And That's Fine)

Here's what changed in September/October 2025:

I don't need to know design patterns anymore. Or architectural best practices. Or the right way to structure code.

The AI knows them. All of them.

My job isn't to architect anymore. It's to:
- Understand what the business actually needs
- Know where the complexity hides
- Spot the edge cases from experience
- Decide what's good enough vs. what needs to be robust

The AI provides the patterns. The structure. The best practices.

I provide the judgment. The business context. The "yeah, but in reality..." knowledge.

This is still scrappy hacking. But now my scrappy ideas get implemented with professional-grade code structure.

I built a sales pipeline integration last month. Seven different data sources. Complex matching logic. Exception handling. Audit logs.

I described the business problem. The AI asked clarifying questions. Suggested architectural approaches. I picked the one that matched our actual needs (not the most elegant one).

It implemented it. Clean code. Good structure. Production-ready.

Two weeks. One person (me, not a real developer). Working solution.

The scrappy part? I didn't architect it properly first. I didn't write formal specs. I didn't design the database schema on paper.

I just started. Described what I needed. Iterated as I learned. Adapted as the real requirements emerged.

Scrappy. But with AI providing the professional implementation.

That's the new game. I bring the business knowledge and scrappy experimental mindset. AI brings the technical chops.

Neither of us could do it alone. Together, we ship.

## 5. Agentic AI Wants To Be Pointed, Not Programmed

Here's what I'm learning in late 2025:

The best way to work with AI isn't to give it detailed instructions. It's to give it direction and let it figure out the path.

Real developers are trained to be precise. Specify everything. Leave nothing to interpretation. That's how you write code.

But that's not how you work with agentic AI.

You point. You describe the outcome. You provide context. Then you let it explore.

"I need to integrate these three systems. Here's the business logic. Here are the edge cases I know about. Figure out the best approach."

And it does. It researches the APIs. It considers different architectural approaches. It asks about tradeoffs. Then it implements.

This is deeply uncomfortable for real developers. "But what if it makes the wrong choice?"

Then you adjust. Iterate. Learn together.

This is natural for scrappy hackers. We've always worked this way. Try something. See what breaks. Adapt. Ship the next version.

The difference now? The AI is doing the technical implementation. But the mindset is pure scrappy hacking.

Point, don't program. Describe outcomes, not steps. Provide context, not specifications.

Let the AI explore. Let it reason. Let it make choices.

You're the guide. The business expert. The person who knows what "good enough" looks like.

AI is the technical expert. The implementer. The one who knows the patterns.

Together, you're scrappy at scale. Experimental, but with production-grade results.

This wouldn't work with old AI. You needed to be precise or you'd get garbage.

But September 2025 changed that. Now you can be directional. Strategic. Let the AI handle tactical.

That's not programming. That's collaboration. With something that's not human, but thinks.

Welcome to scrappy hacking in the agentic age.

## 6. Multi-Agent Workflows: Scrappy Just Got Scalable

Here's the newest pattern I'm experimenting with:

Multiple AI agents working in parallel. Each one tackling a piece of a complex problem. Coordinating through shared context in the IDE.

This sounds like enterprise architecture. But it's scrappy as hell.

One agent researching the API integration patterns. Another building the data transformation logic. A third handling error conditions and logging. A fourth writing tests.

All simultaneously. All in the same VS Code workspace. All sharing context through files.

I'm cycling between them. Nudging each forward. Checking their reasoning. Adjusting direction.

This is impossible for a single human developer. Too much context to hold. Too many pieces to coordinate.

But it's natural for a scrappy hacker with AI collaborators.

I don't need to be in all of them constantly. I check in. I adjust. I make judgment calls about which pieces need more attention.

The agents maintain their own context. Remember their own progress. Make decisions within their scope.

I'm the conductor. Not playing every instrument. Just keeping the orchestra in sync.

Last week, I built a complex reporting system this way. Four agents. Different aspects of the problem. Running in parallel IDE windows.

Research and planning agent: exploring the data sources, documenting patterns.

Data pipeline agent: building the ETL logic.

Visualization agent: creating the dashboard.

Testing agent: validating edge cases.

Me: cycling between them, checking in every 20-30 minutes, making strategic decisions, testing the integrations.

Five days. Working system. Production-deployed.

Would a real developer team do it this way? Probably not. They'd have formal handoffs. Coordinated sprints. Integration meetings.

But this worked. This shipped. This created value.

It's scrappy hacking scaled up. Multiple collaborators (AI agents). Loose coordination. Fast iteration. Ship and learn.

The breakthrough isn't the technology. It's realizing that the scrappy mindset works at scale now.

You don't need to become a "real developer." You need to become a good conductor.

Point multiple AIs in the right direction. Let them work semi-autonomously. Check in to coordinate. Make judgment calls. Ship fast.

That's the future of scrappy hacking. And honestly, it feels like where business technology was always heading.

Not perfect. Not architecturally pure. But fast, adaptive, and valuable.

## What This Means for Business Technology

I spent 15 years feeling like a second-class citizen in the technology world.

Real developers had computer science degrees. I had a business background and learned to hack.

Real developers built architecturally sound systems. I built scrappy solutions that worked.

Real developers got respect. I got "well, that's not really development."

But here's what I learned:

**For most business problems, scrappy beats perfect.**

Not because perfect isn't better. Because perfect takes too long. Costs too much. Can't adapt fast enough.

Business moves faster than enterprise IT. Always has. Always will.

The scrappy hackers who could build fast, adapt quickly, and ship constantly? We've been creating the majority of actual business value.

We just didn't get credit for it.

November 2025 changes the equation.

Now scrappy hackers can build at scrappy speed with professional-grade implementation.

We can experiment fast and ship production systems.

We can point AI agents and coordinate complex work.

We can embrace the mess of real data and build solutions that work in reality, not just in theory.

The real developers will adapt. They'll learn to work with AI. They'll bring architectural thinking to bigger problems.

But the scrappy hackers? This is our moment.

We've always known how to:
- Ship fast and iterate
- Embrace imperfection
- Work with messy reality
- Create value over elegance
- Experiment and learn

Now we have AI that handles the technical implementation. That knows the patterns. That writes clean code.

Combined with our business knowledge and scrappy mindset?

That's a competitive advantage.

## My Advice If You're "Not a Real Developer"

If you've spent years feeling like you're not technical enough. Not a "real" developer. Just hacking things together.

Good. That's exactly the mindset you need for November 2025.

Don't try to become a real developer. Double down on being a scrappy hacker.

Learn to:
- Point AI agents toward outcomes
- Coordinate multiple AI collaborators
- Mind the data and the context
- Ship fast and iterate constantly
- Embrace good enough over perfect
- Work with messy reality, not clean theory

The AI will handle:
- Clean code structure
- Design patterns
- Best practices
- Technical implementation
- Architectural patterns

You focus on:
- Business value
- Real-world complexity
- Judgment calls
- What's good enough
- What matters and what doesn't

That combination? That's the new competitive advantage.

Not "real development." Not "AI does everything."

Scrappy hackers collaborating with agentic AI.

Fast, adaptive, valuable.

That's the future. And we've been training for it our whole careers without knowing it.

## The Scrappy Hacker's Moment

I've been "not a real developer" for 15 years.

Built more value than I can count. Automated thousands of hours of manual work. Created systems that generated millions in revenue.

All while feeling like I wasn't doing it "right."

November 2025 is when I realized: I've been doing it exactly right. Just early.

Scrappy hacking isn't a workaround for not being a real developer.

It's a legitimate strategy for business technology. Especially now.

Fast beats perfect. Adaptive beats planned. Good enough beats architected-for-the-future.

When you have AI handling the technical implementation? Scrappy becomes a superpower.

So if you're not a real developer? Join me.

Let's build scrappy, ship fast, iterate constantly, and create ridiculous amounts of value.

The real developers can keep debating architecture patterns.

We'll be shipping.

## P.S. To Real Developers Reading This

I'm not actually against you. Some of my best friends are real developers.

You bring value that scrappy hackers can't. Architectural thinking for true enterprise systems. Performance optimization at scale. Security expertise. Deep algorithmic knowledge.

But here's the thing:

Most business problems don't need that. They need fast, adaptive solutions that work in messy reality.

And increasingly, AI can provide the architectural patterns while business experts provide the judgment.

You'll adapt. You'll find your place in this new world. Probably doing even more interesting work than you do now.

But the scrappy hackers are going to build a lot more stuff. A lot faster.

Not because we're better. Because we've been training for this mindset our whole careers.

No hard feelings. See you in production.
