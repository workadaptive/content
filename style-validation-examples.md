# Style Validation Examples: Chain of Reasoning

*Evaluating additional style influences with examples for validation*

You asked me to explain my reasoning for each suggested writer and provide examples you can review. Here's my thinking process and specific pieces to validate against your voice.

---

## My Selection Criteria (Meta-Reasoning)

Before I get into each writer, here's what I was optimizing for:

**What I was looking for:**
1. **Practitioner credibility** - Writing from doing, not observing
2. **Accessible complexity** - Smart without being academic
3. **Voice distinctiveness** - Recognizable style, not generic
4. **Complementary gaps** - Fills spaces your core five don't cover
5. **Non-overlapping** - Adds something the others don't

**What I was avoiding:**
1. Pure theorists (no skin in the game)
2. Jargon-heavy writers (obscures rather than clarifies)
3. Pure entertainers (style over substance)
4. Too similar to your existing five (redundant)

Now let me walk through each suggestion with my reasoning chain and examples to validate.

---

## Paul Graham (You Already Love Him - Good)

### My Reasoning Chain:

**Why I suggested him:**

1. **Founder/builder perspective** - He's written code, built companies, funded startups. Writing from experience, not theory.

2. **Thinking-in-public style** - His essays feel like watching someone reason through a problem. Not polished conclusions, but the actual thought process.

3. **Contrarian but earned** - When he challenges conventional wisdom, it's because he's seen the pattern repeatedly, not just being provocative.

4. **Tight prose** - Every sentence earns its place. Similar to Tim Ferriss in actionability, but more philosophical.

5. **Pattern recognition across domains** - Startup advice that applies to writing. Programming insights that apply to thinking. He sees structural similarities others miss.

**How he complements your core five:**

- **vs. Tim Ferriss:** More philosophical, less prescriptive. Ferriss says "do this," Graham says "here's why this might be true."
- **vs. Bob Moesta:** Both observe patterns, but Graham is more abstract/general, Moesta more customer-specific.
- **vs. Chris Koerner:** Both value experimentation, but Graham reflects deeply on what experiments mean, Koerner just does them.

**What you'd borrow from him:**

- Essays as extended reasoning (not just articles)
- "What if?" reframes that challenge assumptions
- Building argument step-by-step (doesn't skip logical steps)
- Comfortable with strong claims backed by reasoning
- Aphoristic insight ("X is just Y") that sticks

### Examples to Validate:

**1. "How to Do Great Work" (2023)**
- URL: http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html
- Why this one: Recent, mature Graham. Shows his full method. Long essay that builds complexity progressively.
- What to look for: How he structures around questions. How he builds to insights rather than stating them upfront. Voice is conversational but precise.

**2. "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule" (2009)**
- URL: http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html
- Why this one: Classic PG. One insight, built systematically. Explains something you've experienced but never articulated.
- What to look for: Simple observation → explored from multiple angles → implications. This is the structure he uses repeatedly.

**3. "The Age of the Essay" (2004)**
- URL: http://paulgraham.com/essay.html
- Why this one: Meta - essay about essays. Shows his thinking about thinking. Explains his own method.
- What to look for: How he uses personal experience (his own writing process) to illustrate larger points.

**4. "Schlep Blindness" (2012)**
- URL: http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html
- Why this one: Coins a term that captures something real. Short, punchy, memorable.
- What to look for: Pattern recognition. He noticed founders avoiding hard-but-valuable problems, named it, explained why it happens.

**Validation questions:**
- Does his reasoning style resonate? (Step-by-step building to insight)
- Does the voice feel right? (Conversational but not casual, precise but not academic)
- Would you want to write essays like this? (If yes, he's a good influence)

## William Zinsser

### My Reasoning Chain:

**Why I suggested him:**

1. **Clarity obsession** - "On Writing Well" is about stripping unnecessary words. Your content is already clearer than most, but Zinsser would push it further.

2. **Humanity in nonfiction** - He argues technical writing should still have a human voice. Directly relevant to business/technical content.

3. **Craft focus** - He's not about creativity or inspiration. He's about the mechanics: how to make prose clear, how to revise, how to structure.

4. **Reader respect** - His whole philosophy is "don't waste the reader's time." Every word must earn its place.

5. **Rewriting is writing** - First draft gets thoughts down. Revision makes them good. This matches how you work with AI (iterate, refine, cut).

**How he complements your core five:**

- **vs. Tim Ferriss:** Ferriss focuses on content structure, Zinsser on sentence-level craft.
- **vs. John McPhee:** McPhee is about architecture and narrative, Zinsser is about clarity and economy.
- **vs. Anne Lamott:** Both about process, but Lamott gives permission to be messy, Zinsser teaches how to clean it up.

**What you'd borrow from him:**

- Ruthless cutting (can you lose 20% without losing meaning?)
- Active voice default (unless passive serves a purpose)
- Read-aloud test (does it sound like a human talking?)
- Trust the reader (don't explain what's already clear)
- Warmth without folkiness

**Concerns I had:**

- His examples are dated (1970s-1990s)
- Could feel too prescriptive ("never do X")
- Might conflict with your more conversational, exploratory style

**Why I included him anyway:**

- His principles are timeless even if examples are dated
- You can borrow the craft focus without the rigidity
- He'd make your already-good writing even tighter

### Examples to Validate:

**1. "On Writing Well" (book, 1976/2006)**
- Get it from: Library, Amazon, or read excerpts
- Chapters to read first: 
  - Chapter 2: "Simplicity"
  - Chapter 5: "The Audience"
  - Chapter 12: "Writing About People: The Interview"
- Why these: Core principles. Shows his method. "People" chapter most relevant to your interview-heavy, anecdote-driven style.

**2. Sample passage from "On Writing Well":**

> "Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills, and meaningless jargon... The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what—these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence."

**What to notice:** 
- Practices what he preaches (clear, direct)
- Strong declarative statements
- Builds through examples
- Not hedging or apologizing

**3. His advice on voice (from Chapter 5):**

> "You are writing for yourself. Don't try to visualize the great mass audience. There is no such audience—every reader is a different person... Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. If you're not a person who says 'indeed' or 'moreover,' or who calls someone an individual ('he's a fine individual'), please don't write it."

**Validation questions:**
- Does his clarity obsession resonate? (Or feel too rigid?)
- Would his cutting exercise help? (Read a paragraph, cut 20%, is it better?)
- Do his principles feel restrictive or liberating?

**My recommendation:** Read Chapter 2 and Chapter 5. If those resonate, read the whole book. If they feel too prescriptive, skip him.

## Derek Sivers

### My Reasoning Chain:

**Why I suggested him:**

1. **Extreme brevity** - Most of his posts are 200-500 words. Says it fast, says it clearly, stops. Counterbalance to your longer pieces.

2. **Unconventional angles** - Finds the non-obvious insight. "Hell Yeah or No" captures something real in two words.

3. **Lived experience** - Built CD Baby, sold it, gave away $22M, lives nomadically. Writing comes from doing unusual things.

4. **Aphoristic but not gimmicky** - His memorable phrases actually carry meaning. Not just punchy for the sake of punchy.

5. **Generosity without universalism** - Shares what worked FOR HIM, doesn't claim it's THE WAY. "This might not work for you" humility.

**How he complements your core five:**

- **vs. Tim Ferriss:** Both practical, but Sivers is more philosophical. Ferriss gives systems, Sivers gives perspectives.
- **vs. Paul Graham:** Both contrarian, but Sivers is more personal/experiential, Graham more analytical.
- **vs. Chris Koerner:** Both experimental, but Sivers reflects deeply on results, Koerner just keeps moving.

**What you'd borrow from him:**

- Shorter than you think you need to be
- Lead with the insight (explain after, if needed)
- End with a question (invite thinking, not just conclusion)
- Personal stories that illustrate universal patterns
- Comfortable saying "this worked for me" without claiming universality

**Concerns I had:**

- His brevity style might not fit your longer thought-leadership pieces
- Could feel too aphoristic (style over substance)
- His nomadic/minimalist life might not resonate with your B2B/BI world

**Why I included him anyway:**

- You could use his brevity for LinkedIn posts, emails, intros
- His "find the unexpected angle" skill is universally valuable
- Demonstrates you don't need 3,000 words to have impact

### Examples to Validate:

**1. "Hell Yeah or No" (short book/compilation, 2020)**
- URL: https://sive.rs/n (free to read online)
- Why this one: Collection of his best short pieces. Shows his range and style.
- Start with these essays from the book:
  - "Hell Yeah or No" (the title essay)
  - "You don't have to be local"
  - "Subtract"

**2. "There's no speed limit" (2009)**
- URL: https://sive.rs/kimo
- Why this one: Story about his music teacher. Shows how he uses specific anecdote to illustrate bigger truth.
- What to look for: Opens with scene, builds to insight, ends with implication. All in ~400 words.

**3. "How to ask your mentors for help" (2016)**
- URL: https://sive.rs/ment
- Why this one: Practical advice delivered concisely. Similar tone to what you're doing for BI professionals.
- What to look for: Actionable steps, clear reasoning, no fluff.

**4. "Obvious to you. Amazing to others." (2010)**
- URL: https://sive.rs/obvious
- Why this one: Captures something everyone in knowledge work needs to hear.
- What to look for: How he takes a simple observation and explores implications without overexplaining.

**5. Browse his full archive:**
- URL: https://sive.rs/blog
- Scroll through titles. Read 5-10 that catch your eye.
- What to look for: Does the brevity feel refreshing or incomplete? Do insights land or feel superficial?

**Validation questions:**
- Does his brevity feel like clarity or incompleteness?
- Do his unconventional angles resonate or feel contrived?
- Could you write shorter pieces in this style for certain contexts?
- Would his approach work for LinkedIn posts, email sequences, or intros?

**My recommendation:** Read "There's no speed limit" and "Obvious to you. Amazing to others." If those feel right, explore more. If they feel too brief or detached from your B2B world, skip him.

## Anne Lamott

### My Reasoning Chain:

**Why I suggested her:**

1. **Process transparency** - "Bird by Bird" demystifies writing. Shows the messy reality behind polished output.

2. **Permission-giving** - "Shitty first drafts" gives people permission to start badly. Directly relevant to your "scrappy hacker" identity.

3. **Anxiety management** - She's funny about the voice that says "who am I to write this?" Relevant for business experts who feel "not technical enough."

4. **Observation as raw material** - She teaches noticing what you notice. Useful for your anecdote-heavy style.

5. **Small assignments** - "Bird by bird" = one small thing at a time. Counteracts overwhelm.

**How she complements your core five:**

- **vs. Tim Ferriss:** He's about systems and results. She's about process and permission.
- **vs. Bob Moesta:** Both observe human behavior, but she's introspective (internal struggle), he's external (customer struggle).
- **vs. William Zinsser:** He teaches craft, she teaches how to overcome blocks and start writing.

**What you'd borrow from her:**

- Give readers permission to experiment messily
- Be transparent about struggles ("here's what I tried first, here's what failed")
- Use humor to defuse anxiety and impostor syndrome
- Break overwhelming tasks into small pieces
- Show the rough edges (not just polished results)

**Concerns I had:**

- Her examples are fiction-focused (memoir, novels)
- Very personal/emotional tone might not fit business content
- Could feel too "soft" for your B2B/technical audience
- Some spiritual/12-step references might not resonate

**Why I included her anyway:**

- Her process advice applies to all writing (not just fiction)
- Your "not a real developer" piece already has this vulnerability
- Business experts need permission-giving too ("you don't need to be perfect")
- Her humor about anxiety is universally relevant

### Examples to Validate:

**1. "Bird by Bird" (book, 1994)**
- Get it from: Library, Amazon
- Chapters to read first:
  - "Shitty First Drafts" (Chapter 1 after intro)
  - "Perfectionism" 
  - "Radio Station KFKD" (the voice in your head)
- Why these: Core philosophy. Most practical. Least fiction-specific.

**2. Key passage on "Shitty First Drafts":**

> "All good writers write them. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts... The first draft is the child's draft, where you let it all pour out and then let it romp all over the place, knowing that no one is going to see it and that you can shape it later... The first draft is the down draft—you just get it down. The second draft is the up draft—you fix it up. You try to say what you have to say more accurately. And the third draft is the dental draft, where you check every tooth, to see if it's loose or cramped or decayed, or even, God help us, healthy."

**What to notice:**
- Permission-giving tone
- Metaphors that make process concrete
- Humor ("dental draft")
- Practical (three-draft framework)

**3. Key passage on "Radio Station KFKD":**

> "If you are not careful, station KFKD will play in your head twenty-four hours a day, nonstop, in stereo... Out of the right speaker in your inner ear will come the endless stream of self-aggrandizement, the recitation of one's specialness, of how much more open and gifted and brilliant and knowing and misunderstood and humble one is. Out of the left speaker will be the rap songs of self-loathing, the lists of all the things one doesn't do well, of all the mistakes one has made today and over an entire lifetime."

**What to notice:**
- Specific, vivid metaphor (radio station)
- Names the internal critic everyone has
- Humorous but serious
- Normalize the struggle

**4. Browse her essays:**
- Some Are Sicker Than Others (1996) - About her friend dying
- Ashes (1997) - About her mother's death
- These are VERY personal. Not business-appropriate. But show her style.

**Validation questions:**
- Does her permission-giving tone feel useful or too soft?
- Would "shitty first drafts" language work for your audience?
- Can you borrow the process transparency without the personal intensity?
- Does her humor about anxiety resonate?

**My recommendation:** Read "Shitty First Drafts" chapter only. If that feels useful for your "scrappy hacker" framing, read more. If it feels too personal/emotional for your B2B context, skip her but keep the "permission to iterate messily" concept.

## Summary: How to Validate

Here's my suggested approach:

### Phase 1: Quick Validation (30 minutes)

**Paul Graham:**
- Read "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule" (10 min)
- Ask: Does this reasoning style feel right?

**Derek Sivers:**
- Read "There's no speed limit" and "Obvious to you" (10 min)
- Ask: Does this brevity feel like clarity or incompleteness?

**William Zinsser:**
- Read Chapter 2 excerpt or find PDF of "Simplicity" chapter (10 min)
- Ask: Does his clarity obsession resonate or feel too rigid?

### Phase 2: Deep Validation (If quick validation passed)

**Paul Graham:**
- Read "How to Do Great Work" (full essay)
- Pick 2-3 more from his archive that interest you

**Derek Sivers:**
- Read "Hell Yeah or No" collection (it's short)
- Browse his blog for 10 pieces

**William Zinsser:**
- Get "On Writing Well" from library
- Read Chapters 2, 5, 12

**Anne Lamott:**
- Get "Bird by Bird" from library
- Read "Shitty First Drafts" chapter
- Decide if you want more

### Phase 3: Decide What to Keep

For each writer, ask:

1. **Does their voice resonate with mine?**
2. **Do they fill a gap my current five don't cover?**
3. **Can I borrow specific techniques without just imitating?**
4. **Would they make my writing better or just different?**

### My Predictions:

**Paul Graham: KEEP**
- You already love him
- Complements your existing voices perfectly
- Essay-as-reasoning style fits your thought leadership

**Derek Sivers: MAYBE**
- Depends on whether brevity feels freeing or limiting
- Useful for specific contexts (LinkedIn, emails) even if not full articles
- Try writing one Sivers-style piece and see how it feels

**William Zinsser: KEEP (PRINCIPLES)**
- Even if his book feels dated, principles are solid
- Use as editing framework, not style guide
- "Can I cut 20%?" is always useful

**Anne Lamott: BORROW CONCEPTS, SKIP STYLE**
- "Shitty first drafts" = permission to iterate messily = useful
- Her personal/emotional style probably too much for B2B content
- Take the concepts, leave the memoir voice

---

## My Reasoning for Excluding Others

You might wonder why I didn't suggest:

**Malcolm Gladwell:**
- Considered him (narrative + social science)
- Excluded because: Style over substance concerns, pop science criticisms, overreliance on "aha" structure
- You get better version from McPhee (narrative) + Christensen (theory)

**Seth Godin:**
- Considered him (brief, punchy, marketing focused)
- Excluded because: Too similar to Derek Sivers, more marketing-specific, sometimes gimmicky
- You get better version from Sivers (brevity) + Ferriss (practical)

**James Clear:**
- Considered him (Atomic Habits, behavior change)
- Excluded because: Too narrow (habits focus), overlap with Christensen (frameworks), less distinctive voice
- You get better version from Ferriss (systems) + Christensen (theory)

**Cal Newport:**
- Considered him (Deep Work, knowledge work productivity)
- Excluded because: Directly overlaps with your content (might feel too similar), academic tone, younger voice might not fit
- Relevant topics but could compete with your positioning

**Morgan Housel:**
- Considered him (Psychology of Money, narrative + insight)
- Excluded because: Finance-specific, relatively new, unclear if style translates to your domain
- Interesting but unproven for your needs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Quick validation** on the three suggested (Graham, Sivers, Zinsser)
2. **Report back** what resonated and what didn't
3. **I'll adjust** the style guide based on your validation
4. **We iterate** until you have a reference set that genuinely serves your voice development

The goal isn't to imitate any of these writers. It's to:
- Borrow specific techniques that enhance your natural voice
- Fill gaps in your current toolkit
- Have language for what works and what doesn't

Sound good?
