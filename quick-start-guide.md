## Common Objections & Answers

**"We need IT approval for new tools"**  
Start the conversation now. Most IT teams approve VS Code + Copilot quickly once they understand the use case and governance.

**"Our person doesn't have time for 15 hours over a month"**  
If you can't find 15 hours for something that will save 200+ hours, that's the problem we're solving.

**"What if it doesn't work?"**  
We've done this successfully with 20+ organizations. The approach works when you pick the right first project and follow the process.

**"We want to see more examples first"**  
Your competitors stopped asking for more examples 6 months ago. They're now building their third and fourth solutions.

**"What if the person who builds it leaves?"**  
The solution is documented, maintainable code—easier to hand off than tribal knowledge in Excel macros. Plus you'll train 2-3 people, not just one.
